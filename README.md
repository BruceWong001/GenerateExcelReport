# GenerateExcelReport

I wanna write a common lib to generate Excel for report purpose. 
I will use Aspose as a default lib to generate excel from scratch, but I will use OpenXML as a altertive approach, so that you can choose which is good for you.
The basic function should include generating table, merge cell, setting front,color,style. In the future, There will be chart, pivot or more advance feature.
Current is from very beginning, I will keep update. 
It welcomes if you wanna contribute any code, idea or feedback.
